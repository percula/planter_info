## Introduction
To keep the plant list tidy, plant varieties are listed in the Varieties tab of each plant. For instance, zucchini is listed as a variety of squash. You don't need to use the varieties feature to create a garden, but it's very useful if you're planting multiple varieties of the same plant, such as cherry and plum tomatoes.

## Creating custom varieties
If the app does not have a variety you are planting, you can add a custom variety:

1. Open the plant that you'd like to add a custom variety for
2. Swipe over to the Varieties tab.
3. Tap the "+" button.
4. Enter the variety name and (optionally) a short and long description.
5. Optionally choose an icon and image.
5. Tap "Save".
