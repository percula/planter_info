## Introduction
To keep the plant list tidy, plant varieties are listed in the Varieties tab of each plant. For instance, zucchini is listed as a variety of squash. You don't need to use the varieties feature to create a garden, but it's very useful if you're planting multiple varieties of the same plant, such as cherry and plum tomatoes.


## Selecting varieties
You can plant multiple varieties in the same garden. Since there are dozens of varieties for some plants,
Planter shows your favorite and most-recent varieties in a handy drop-down menu. Simply favorite the 
plant varieties that you have in your garden. Custom varieties are automatically favorited for you.
