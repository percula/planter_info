## Introduction
The calendar feature let's you quickly see which plants you can start inside, transplant, or sow outside.

## Setting frost dates
For temperate regions, knowing your frost date is vital to having a successful garden. Planter has a global database of weather stations to help determine your frost date. 

To set your frost date:
1. Go to Settings
2. Tap "Weather Station" and follow the prompts

If Planter cannot find a weather station near you, manually enter your frost dates:
1. Search on the internet for your frost dates
2. Tap "Spring frost date", then "Set Manually", and enter your spring frost date.
3. Tap "Fall frost date", then "Set Manually", and enter your fall frost date.

### Tropical and hot regions
If you live in a region where the temperature never goes below freezing, you can largely ignore the planting times given by the calendar. Plant cool season crops such as Broccoli and Cabbage in your cool season. Likewise, plant thirsty crops in your rainy season.  

## Filters
You can filter the calendar to only show plants that are in your <a href="https://info.gardenplanter.app/plants#marking-a-plant-as-a-favorite">favorites</a> or in your garden.

You can further filter plants to show only those you can take action on now with the "Start inside now", "Transplant now", and "Sow outdoors now" filters.
