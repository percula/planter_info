## Introduction
The calendar feature let's you quickly see which plants you can start inside, transplant, or sow outside.

## Filters
You can filter the calendar to only show plants that are in your <a href="https://info.gardenplanter.app/plants#marking-a-plant-as-a-favorite">favorites</a> or in your garden.

You can further filter plants to show only those you can take action on now with the "Start inside now", "Transplant now", and "Sow outdoors now" filters.
