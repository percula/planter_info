## What do those green and red circles mean?

Green circles mean the adjacent plants are companions and work well together.

Red circles mean the adjacent plants are combative and shouldn't be planted. These circles also have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them.

Yellow circles mean that some varieties of the plants are compatible while others are combative.
