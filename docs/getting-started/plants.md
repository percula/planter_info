## I don't see zucchini, green onions, or red peppers? Where are they?
These are listed in the varieties tab of the plant.

## Why doesn't Planter have {name of plant}?

Please feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://mailhide.io/e/IIRlz">send me your plant requests</a>. While you're waiting for me to add it, you can create a [custom plant](https://youtu.be/ox65gthSCDM) or [variety](https://youtu.be/r_NDs-RGTuU).

I try my best to add plants, but it is a time consuming task. This is not my full-time job and I have 2 young kids, so as you can imagine it's hard to find the time. Thanks for your understanding ðŸ˜‰. 

## Spacing

In Planter, plants are spaced per square-foot-gardening guidelines. For instance, if you see a circle with 4Ã— in it, that indicates you can plant 4 plants in that square. Each square is one square foot (or 1/9 square meter).
