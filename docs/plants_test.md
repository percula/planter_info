2. Tap "Edit".

## Marking a plant as a "Favorite"

## I don't see zucchini, green onions, or red peppers? Where are they?
These are listed in the [varieties]({% link docs/varieties.md %}) tab of the plant.

## Why doesn't Planter have {name of plant}?

Please use the "Plants and Feature Requests" forum, which you can find in Settings. If the plant you're looking for has already been requested, please upvote it! This helps us prioritize which plants to add. While you're waiting for it to be added, you can create a custom plant or variety.

## Spacing

In Planter, plants are spaced per square-foot-gardening guidelines. For instance, if you see a circle with 4Ã— in it, that indicates you can plant 4 plants in that square. Each square is one square foot (or 1/9 square meter).
