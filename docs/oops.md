title: Bugs in your garden üêõ ... and Planter. Oops!
---

# What happened?
To release the web version (https://planter.garden), I changed a whole bunch of code behind-the-scenes. 
Unfortunately, a bug made it's way into the 3.1.0 iOS release that prevented gardeners from opening their
gardens. This bug has been fixed in 3.1.1 and is now available in the App Store for download. You'll need to 
manually update Planter to receive the update today, since the new version is slowly rolling out
to users. Less than 1% of users received the bad build, but I know how important Planter is to
you all, so I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this may have caused.

Many of you reached out to me via the "report a bug" tool in the app. Thank you! We were able to
catch and fix this bug within 24 hours thanks to you. Unfortunately, the new update also included
a new version of the bug reporting tool that doesn't ask for emails, so my apologies for not
responding to you like I usually do. I'm fixing _that_ in the next update.
