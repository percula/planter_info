This quickstart shows you how to create your first garden and add plants.

## Creating your first garden
1. Tap the "+ New Garden" button
2. Enter the garden name
3. Enter the dimensions of the garden. Note that the size is limited, since large gardens can lead to slow performance on some devices.

> Hint: You can switch between imperial and metric units in Settings

## Viewing and interacting with your garden
- Use two fingers and pinch to zoom in or out
- When zoomed in, use a single finger to pan
- Tap on a plant to view it
- Long-press on a square and release to select it. This will bring you into multi-select mode, where you can select additional squares before selecting an action.

## Adding plants to the garden
1. Tap the "+ Add Plants" button
2. Find the plant you'd like to add in the list. You can search or filter the list.
3. Optionally, select the variety of the plant by tapping the drop-down icon (see Varieties documentation for more info)
4. Long-press on the plant to drag-and-drop it into your garden.
  - The final location of the plant will be highlighted. If any existing plants overlap, they'll be highlighted in red and will be deleted if you drop the plant.
  - If you change your mind and don't want to drop the plant, drag it onto the garbage icon
  - Note: If the plant requires spacing larger than your garden, you won't be able to drag-and-drop it.

## Compatibility indicators

You may have noticed green and red circles between your plants. These are compatibility indicators, to help with companion planting.

Green circles mean the adjacent plants are companions and work well together.

Red circles mean the adjacent plants are combative and shouldn't be planted. These circles also have a darker inner circle to help color-blind gardeners identify them.

Yellow circles mean that some varieties of the plants are companions while others are combative.

## Spacing indicators

If you see a circle with 4Ã— in it, that indicates you can plant 4 plants in that square. Each square is one square foot (or 1/9 square meter). For more information, see [Plant Spacing](https://info.gardenplanter.app/plants#spacing)

## Customizing the background (premium feature)

You can add raised beds, pots, hoses, and more. You can also change the background to grass, mulch, or rocks.
